            Today I turn 22... <br><br><br><br><br>

        There are a lot of things I can say about the last 365 days.<br><br><br>
        
        But it is nothing in comparison to what will happen over the next.<br><br><br>
        
        I am surrounded by the best. Best business partner, mentors, clients and friends.<br><br><br>
        
        But the person I really need to thank for my success, is my incredible wife.<br><br><br>
        
        She has had confidence in me when I was lacking..<br><br><br>
        
        She allowed me to quit my job and pursue my dreams.<br><br><br>
        
        I have never had to over explain why I am working late or early.<br><br><br>
        
        Overall, she is out of my league. She is beautiful, caring, and the reason I am able to do what I do.<br><br><br>
        
        When you find someone in life who shares your dream, and vision, keep them close.
